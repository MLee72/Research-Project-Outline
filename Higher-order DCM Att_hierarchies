Tentative Title: Two approaches for higher-order diagnostic classification models when attribute hierarchies exist: Theory, estimation, and application.

Abstract:
While diagnostic classification models (DCMs) have become popular for two decades,
There has been a lack of research on the estimation of higher-order DCMs when attribute hierarchies exist.
With attribute hierarchy and K attributes, impossible profile patterns occur from 2^K full profile patterns, whose probabilities are fixed at 0.
In DCMs, the attributes are often highly correlated, so higher-order DCMs have proved their usefulness in summarizing the characteristics of attributes.
Nevertheless, combining attribute hierarchy structures and higher-order models has not been fully studied, except for one study utilizing the item response tree approach via Bayesian estimation.
This study introduces two approaches for dealing with attribute hierarchy under the framework of the higher-order DCM, which are 1) attribute response tree and 2) nominal response model approaches.
The full-information maximum likelihood estimation via the EM algorithm and limited-information goodness-of-fit testing are developed by the authors.
Simulation studies and empirical data applications will show the effectiveness of the two approaches.
