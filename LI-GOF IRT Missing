Tentative Title: Missing Data Treatment in IRT Limited-Information Goodness-of-Fit Testing

Abstract:
Limitied-information goodness-of-fit (LI-GOF) testing has proved to result in correct empirical rejection rates and high power by resolving the sparseness of item response data when many items are used.
However, the theory has been developed under the assumption of complete item response data, even though missing item responses are almost inevitable in practice.
There are two types of missing item responses.
First, intended (or planned) missing item responses result from the assessment data collection design, such as matrix sampling and anchor item design in test equating.
Second, unintended missing item responses can be produced by underlying missing data mechanisms (e.g., missing at random and missing not at random by Rubin).
When missing item responses exist, LI-GOF testing suffers from the inability to deal with those missing item responses appropriately.
This is firstly because low-order sample margins will be biased and secondly because the distribution of LI-GOF test statistics is not known when missing data exists.
This study introduces how to treat those intended and unintended missing item responses.
Simulation studies will be conducted to empirically show whether the introduced methods recover nominal rejection rates (when a model is correctly specified) and produce enough power to detect model misspecification.
