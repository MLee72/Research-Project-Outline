Tentative Title: An Alternative Procedure of Multiple Imputation in Item Response Theory: A Stacking Approach

Abstract: 
While the full-information maximum likelihood (FIML) estimation is popular in current practices, FIML is not flexible (e.g., auxiliary variable and covariates) and not available for limited-information goodness-of-fit (LI-GOF) testing.
Multiple imputation (MI) can handle such limitations of FIML by constructing a set of pseudo-complete datasets from Baysian models.
However, the conventional procedure of MI turns out to produce high computational costs because many imputations are required and many respondents are included in many IRT practices.
Numerical integrations in the popular EM-algorithm will exponentially increase this computational burden when multidimensional IRT models are used.
To address this issue, this study proposes an alternative procedure of data analyses with multiple imputed data in IRT.
The basic idea is to estimate a large dataset where individual pseudo-complete datasets are stacked instead of separately analyzing them, which is justified by Fisher's identity.
Standard error computation is direct by utilizing missing information principle.
LI-GOF testing is also available due to the works of Rubin and colleagues.
The study shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach via a simulation study and empirical data analysis.
